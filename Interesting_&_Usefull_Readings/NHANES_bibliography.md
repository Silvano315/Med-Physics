## Overview
This research project leverages the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset to investigate the relationships between cardiovascular biomarkers, frailty indicators, and neurological markers in the US population. The study aims to comprehensively analyze these health parameters by utilizing various statistical and analytical techniques.
The primary focus areas include:
- Analysis of cardiovascular biomarkers to assess heart health and disease risk
- Evaluation of frailty measurements and their correlations with other health indicators
- Investigation of neurological markers where available in the dataset
This documentation serves as a comprehensive record of the analytical methods, tools, and bibliographic resources used throughout the research process. The project emphasizes the technical aspects of data analysis, including statistical methodologies, programming approaches, and data processing techniques employed to extract meaningful insights from the NHANES dataset.
