# Brain health assessment in cardiometabolic diseases

Hi everyone, I'm a Researcher and Data Scientist at the Healthcare hospital in Bari. I'm working on the PNRR project "Brain health assessment in cardiometabolic diseases: impact of frailty and biomarkers on healthcare management". I perform statistical analysis and data science initiatives to uncover patterns in brain health and cardiometabolic disease data.

This would be a readme file about some interesting and useful readings about some topics I'm working on during my job.:

1. "Blood biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease in the community: Variation by chronic diseases and inflammatory status" [here](https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/alz.13860)
2. "Explainable machine learning model for pre‐frailty risk assessment in community‐dwelling older adults" [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hcs2.120)
